  "content": "# Database Connection Pooling\n\n## Overview\n\nThis feature introduces a new `db.py` module to manage database connections efficiently through connection pooling. Connection pooling improves performance by reusing existing connections rather than creating new ones for each request, which reduces overhead and latency. This change was implemented to enhance scalability and reliability for database operations in the application.\n\n## Usage\n\nThe new `DB` class in `src/db.py` provides a simple interface for managing pooled connections. Here's an example of how to use it:\n\n```python\nfrom src.db import DB\n\n# Initialize the database connection pool\ndb = DB()\n\n# Connect to the pool\ndb.connect()\n\n# The connection is now ready for use\n# (Database operations would follow here)\n```\n\n## API Reference\n\n### `DB` Class\n\nThe `DB` class encapsulates the connection pooling logic.\n\n#### `connect()`\n\n```python\ndef connect(self):\n    print('Connected to pool')\n```\n\n**Description**: Establishes a connection to the database pool. This method initializes or retrieves a connection from the pool, making it ready for subsequent operations.\n\n**Parameters**: None\n\n**Returns**: None\n\n**Example**:\n```python\ndb = DB()\ndb.connect()  # Prints: Connected to pool\n```"
