  "content": "# Fix: Align Local Branch with Remote\n\n## Overview\nThis fix ensures that the local branch is properly aligned with the remote branch. This is crucial for maintaining synchronization between your local development environment and the shared repository, preventing merge conflicts and ensuring you are working with the latest codebase.\n\n## Usage\nThe logger provides a simple function to print log messages prefixed with `[LOG]:`. This can be used to trace the alignment process or any related debugging.\n\n```python\nfrom logger import log\n\nlog(\"Aligning local branch 'main' with remote 'origin/main'\")\n```\n\n## API Reference\n\n### `log(msg: str) -> None`\nPrints a formatted log message to standard output.\n\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `msg` (str): The message to be logged.\n- **Returns**: None\n- **Example**:\n  ```python\n  log(\"Starting branch alignment process...\")\n  # Output: [LOG]: Starting branch alignment process...\n  ```"
