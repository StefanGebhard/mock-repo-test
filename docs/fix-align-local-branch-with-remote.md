  "content": "# Fix: Align local branch with remote\n\n## Overview\nThis fix ensures that the local branch is properly aligned with the remote branch. This alignment is critical for maintaining consistent state between development environments and preventing conflicts during collaboration. By synchronizing the local branch with its remote counterpart, developers can avoid potential merge issues and ensure they are working with the most up-to-date code.\n\n## Usage\nThe utility function provided in this fix is designed to handle string inputs by converting them to numbers before performing arithmetic operations. This ensures robustness and prevents errors when working with mixed data types.\n\nExample:\n```javascript\nconst { add } = require('./src/utils');\n\nconst sum = add('5', '3'); // Returns 8\nconsole.log(sum);\n```\n\n## API Reference\n- **add(a, b)**: Converts input arguments to numbers and returns their sum. Handles string inputs by converting them to numbers first.\n  - Parameters:\n    - `a`: First operand (can be a string or number)\n    - `b`: Second operand (can be a string or number)\n  - Returns: The sum of `a` and `b` as a number."
