  "content": "# Push: Fix: Align local branch with remote\n\n## Overview\nThis feature addresses the need to synchronize local Git branch state with the remote repository. This is critical when a local branch falls behind the remote due to external commits or when pulling updates is required to avoid conflicts before pushing new changes. The provided script includes a `trigger_push()` function that simulates this scenario by making coordinated changes to both code and documentation files, committing them, and pushing to the configured branch.\n\n## Usage\nThe `trigger_push()` function can be used to generate a realistic push event scenario. It:\n\n1. **Selects a scenario** that involves updating a code file and a documentation file together.\n2. **Modifies the files** with new content.\n3. **Performs Git operations** to stage, commit, and push changes to the remote branch.\n\n```python\n# Example: Triggering a push event\nfrom events_test import trigger_push\n\ntrigger_push()\n```\n\n## API Reference\n\n### `trigger_push()`\n**Description**: Generates and pushes a simulated update that modifies both code and documentation, ensuring local and remote branches stay aligned.\n\n**Behavior**:\n- Picks a random scenario from `get_push_content()`.\n- Writes the selected code and documentation content to their respective files.\n- Runs `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` commands to update the remote.\n\n**Example Output**:\n```\n--- Triggering REALISTIC PUSH ---\nScenario: Update Server Port\n✅ Push complete.\n```\n\n### `get_push_content()`\n**Description**: Returns a random scenario that includes a code change and a corresponding documentation update.\n\n**Return Type**: Dictionary with keys:\n- `name`: Descriptive name of the scenario.\n- `file_code`: Path to the code file to be updated.\n- `content_code`: New content for the code file.\n- `file_doc`: Path to the documentation file to be updated.\n- `content_doc`: New content for the documentation file.\n\n## Configuration\nThe script uses the following configuration variables, which must be set before execution:\n\n- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: GitHub personal access token for API authentication.\n- `REPO_OWNER`: Username of the repository owner.\n- `REPO_NAME`: Name of the repository.\n- `BRANCH_NAME`: Target branch for pushes and PR base (defaults to \"master\").\n\n## Security Note\nThe code includes a placeholder for `GITHUB_TOKEN`. **Never commit real tokens to version control.** Use environment variables or a secure secret management system in production."
